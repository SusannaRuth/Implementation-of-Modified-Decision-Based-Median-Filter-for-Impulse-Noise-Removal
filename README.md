### Implementation of Modified Decision Based Median Filter for Impulse Noise Removal

- This project contains an implementation of a modified decision based median filter to remove impulse noise from corrupted images which gives a better performance than median filter. 
- Also extended it by implementing a non local median filter based on the concept of non local means.
